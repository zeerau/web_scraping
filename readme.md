# Web Scraping Project

## Introduction
This project involves web scraping various websites to extract and analyze data for different use cases. The primary focus is on automating data collection using Python and Selenium, with additional tools for data manipulation and storage. The project includes scraping data from platforms like NAFDAC, Airbnb, Jumia, and FzMovies, among others, to gather insights and create structured datasets.

## Process
1. **Setup**: Installed necessary libraries such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and others. Configured the Chrome WebDriver for browser automation.
2. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Navigated to target websites using Selenium.
   - Interacted with web elements like dropdowns, buttons, and tables to extract relevant data.
   - Used BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content where necessary.
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleaned and structured the extracted data using pandas.
   - Stored the data in CSV files for further analysis.
4. **Automation**: Implemented loops and exception handling to ensure smooth and efficient scraping, even with dynamic web elements.
5. **Output**: Saved the final datasets in CSV format for easy access and analysis.

## Tech Tools
- **Python**: Core programming language for scripting.
- **Selenium**: For browser automation and interaction with dynamic web pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing and extracting data from HTML content.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and creating structured datasets.
- **Chrome WebDriver**: For automating Chrome browser interactions.

## Conclusion
The project successfully automated the extraction of structured data from multiple websites. The datasets generated can be used for further analysis, reporting, or integration into other systems. This project demonstrates the power of web scraping for data collection and the importance of handling dynamic web elements effectively.
