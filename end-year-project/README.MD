# Airbnb Web Scraping Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on automating the extraction of structured data from Airbnb's website using Python and Selenium. The goal is to collect information such as property addresses, descriptions, prices, and host ratings for analysis. The project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to interact with dynamic web elements and extract valuable data for further processing.

## Process
1. **Setup**:
   - Installed necessary libraries such as Selenium, pandas, and others.
   - Configured the Chrome WebDriver for browser automation.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Navigated to Airbnb's website using Selenium.
   - Interacted with web elements like search inputs, buttons, and filters to extract relevant data.
   - Implemented scrolling and pagination to ensure all data was captured.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleaned and structured the extracted data using pandas.
   - Stored the data in a CSV file for further analysis.

4. **Automation**:
   - Used loops and exception handling to ensure smooth scraping# Airbnb Web Scraping Project
